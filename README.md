# Facebook Market Place poster
Hello !
Thanks for reading this guide for the code !

**First**: if you do not have the necceray libraries for the work, you will need to install the requirements by running the following in your terminal:
    --> pip install -r requirements.txt

**Secondly** : 
--> The file **data.csv** contain the Content to post information (Image link, Name, Description, Price ...).
--> The file **group_links.xlsx** contain the Marketplace groups URL link that you want to post in.
--> The images will be auto-downloaded during the work of the code (It will appear in the "images" file).

**Finally**:
Run the script and let the code do the work !!!
    --> it automatically open the browser and post the contents from the data.csv
    --> after it finish, it will close the browser.

**Note**:
    - You can remove the " # " in the line 112 so it will be headless (that means the code will run and do the work whithout opening the browser).
    - I've used the "undected_chromedriver" library so Facebook do not detecte and automation action and block the script .


Thanks for your attention !
Feel free to ask me any question !
